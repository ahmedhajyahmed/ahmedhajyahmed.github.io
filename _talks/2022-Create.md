In the first installment of the CREATE SE4AI Trainee Talks, I had the privilege of sharing my research alongside 
fellow graduate students. This webinar series is dedicated to presenting groundbreaking research in software engineering 
for AI applications to a broader audience.

**Webinar Recording:**  
For those who missed the live webinar or wish to revisit the insightful presentations, the recording is available on
the [CREATE SE4AI YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7owtNM6S0Cg&ab_channel=CREATESE4AI).

**Presentations**

1. **Reliable, Production-Ready Self-Learning Systems:** As a Master's student at Polytechnique Montreal, I focused 
    on introducing "DiverGet: a Search-based Software Testing Approach for Deep Neural Network Quantization Assessment," 
    my latest study aimed at enhancing the reliability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) through innovative testing 
    methodologies. This research underscores the critical need for robust software testing frameworks to ensure the 
    production readiness and reliability of self-learning systems, especially as they become increasingly integral to 
    our daily lives and industries.

2. **Software Production Dependencies:** Following me, Jasmine Latendresse, a PhD candidate from Concordia University, 
shared her insights on managing dependencies in software production. Her presentation, rooted in her recent work 
presented at the IEEE/ACM 2022 Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE '22) in Michigan, shed light on the 
critical role of dependency management in the development and maintenance of AI-based software systems.

**Key Takeaways:**
- An in-depth understanding of the challenges and solutions in software testing and dependency management for 
AI-based systems.
- Insights into the latest research and methodologies aimed at enhancing the reliability and efficiency of 
self-learning and AI-based software systems.
- Engaging discussions on the practical implications and future directions of software engineering research in 
the field of AI.

**Join Me on This Journey:**
I am committed to advancing the field of software engineering for AI through rigorous research and practical 
applications. Stay tuned for more updates on my work and upcoming presentations by visiting my personal site regularly.
