**Presenters:** Rached Bouchoucha and Ahmed Haj Yahmed  

This tutorial, presented at the SEMLA international symposium, focused on the critical task of debugging Deep 
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems. Participants were introduced to RLExplorer, an innovative tool designed 
specifically for fault detection in DRL applications. The session aimed to provide a comprehensive, hands-on 
experience in identifying and rectifying bugs within DRL algorithms.

**Key Components:**
1. **Introduction to Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL):** A foundational overview of DRL, including its key concepts, 
algorithms, and applications.
2. **Challenges of Monitoring DRL:** Exploration of the unique challenges in monitoring and debugging DRL systems, 
such as the non-deterministic nature of DRL and the exploration-exploitation trade-off.
3. **RLExplorer: Fault Detection Tool for DRL Systems:** Introduction to RLExplorer, detailing its fault detection 
capabilities and how it can provide insights into DRL algorithm behavior and performance.
4. **Integrating RLExplorer into a DRL Application:** Step-by-step guide on incorporating RLExplorer into DRL systems, 
complete with code examples and practical tips.
5. **Demo: Fault Detection using RLExplorer:** A live demonstration using RLExplorer to detect and debug real-world 
bugs in a DQN algorithm implementation for the CartPole environment.

**Resources:**

- [Tutorial Summary](https://github.com/ahmedhajyahmed/SEMLA-Tutorial-Debugging-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning)

**Outcome:**
Participants left the tutorial with a solid understanding of DRL, the intricacies of monitoring DRL systems, and 
practical experience in using RLExplorer for effective fault detection. This session empowered attendees with the 
knowledge and tools necessary to enhance the reliability of their DRL applications, marking a significant step forward 
in the debugging of complex machine learning systems.
