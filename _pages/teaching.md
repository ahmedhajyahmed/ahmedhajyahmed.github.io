My teaching approach is deeply anchored in **melding research with practical application**, aiming to arm students
with robust analytical skills and a deep understanding of **Software Engineering (SE)** and **Machine Learning
(ML)**. This methodology emphasizes hands-on learning experiences, where theoretical knowledge meets real-world 
application.

As a **Teaching Assistant** for the **Software Quality Engineering** course at **Polytechnique Montreal**, 
I facilitated lab sessions where students learned how to execute a **quality assurance plan**, analyze **software 
and process measurements** for quality diagnosis, and cultivate a **critical viewpoint on software quality**.

Furthermore, I contributed as a **Teaching Assistant** to the **MLOps Upskilling Program**, jointly developed by 
[IVADO](https://ivado.ca/en/) and [SEMLA](https://semla.polymtl.ca/). This program is tailored to equip software 
professionals with the essential skills for **automating** and **optimizing machine learning model development, 
deployment, and maintenance**, thereby facilitating the efficient incorporation of **AI capabilities** into software 
projects. In the labs, I guided participants through enhancing their ML workflows using **MLOps principles**.
