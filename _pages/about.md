![How AI interpreted my bio.](/images/0.png){: .align-right width="300px"}

Hello there! 🚀 I'm currently weaving magic as an **MLOps specialist** at [Sycodal](https://www.sycodal.com), where
we're busy **revolutionizing** the way small to medium-sized industries work with our **collaborative robots** 🤖.
My day-to-day involves a deep dive into the world of machine learning, **improving** how our robots see 👀,
**learn** 🧠, and **predict** 📈 through cutting-edge **vision recognition models**, **data-driven control modules**,
and **predictive maintenance systems**. And yes, it's as cool as it sounds! But that's not all. I'm also at the
forefront of supporting **academic research projects** in **Software Engineering for Artificial Intelligence (SE4AI)**,
a field that's just as fascinating as it is crucial for the future of tech 🌐.

I hold an **M.Sc.** 👨‍🎓 in software engineering from **Polytechnique Montreal**, where I had the privilege of working
under the supervision of [**Prof. Foutse Khomh**](https://mila.quebec/en/person/foutse-khomh/). During my time there, 
I won the Polytechnique's Best Master's Thesis Award 🏆 in Computer Science and Software Engineering for 2023 and received 
the [**"Mention Spéciale du Jury"**](https://www.polymtl.ca/carrefour-actualite/nouvelles/polytechnique-montreal-decerne-des-recompenses-pour-des-memoires-et-des-theses-remarquables-en-2023) 
🏅 for the across-discipline competition. This experience involved being a  member of the 
[**SWAT Lab**](https://swat.polymtl.ca/), a [**Mila student**](https://mila.quebec/en/),
and a [**SE4AI CREATE trainee**](https://se4ai.org/), working on the **reliability**
and **production-readiness** of **Deep Learning** and **Deep Reinforcement Learning** systems. Prior to my time in
Montreal, I earned my **Engineer Degree** in Software Engineering 👨🏻‍💻 majoring in **Data Science** with honors from
the **National Institute of Applied Science and Technology**, affiliated with the **University of Carthage, Tunisia**.
This rigorous program not only honed my technical skills but also instilled a deep appreciation for the principles
of **software engineering** and **data science**.

My research is at the intersection of **SE and AI** where I published research papers in top-tier scientific journals
and prestigious conferences. My research is primarily focused 🔬 on **MLOps**, **Quality Assurance** of Deep
Learning-based Software Systems, **Software Engineering for ML/AI**, and **dependable** and **trustworthy ML/AI**.
I participated in designing and developing **open-source debugging and testing tools** for deep learning and deep
reinforcement learning programs. I am passionate about staying up to date on the latest **MLOps initiatives** 🌟.

**Interests:**
- **MLOps** (obviously) 💻
- **Software Engineering** 🔧
- **Deep Learning** 🧠
- **Computer Vision** 👁️
- The challenges and thrills of **Deep Reinforcement Learning** 🎢

In a nutshell, I'm all about exploring the intersection of **software engineering** and **AI**, with a keen eye on
how we can make technology both **powerful** and **trustworthy** 🔐. If you're on a similar journey or just curious
about what I do, let's connect and chat about the endless possibilities that technology holds for us 🌟.
