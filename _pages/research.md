My research journey is anchored in the dynamic field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a particular focus on the 
transformative potential of Deep Learning (DL) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). These advanced AI subfields are 
at the heart of my interest, owing to their profound impact on reshaping industries such as robotics, medicine, and 
transportation. The essence of my work lies in bridging the gap between the theoretical development of AI models and 
their practical application, a process encapsulated in the emerging field of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps).


At the core of my research is the exploration of MLOps, a methodology that seeks to harmonize ML development with 
operational practices to enhance software quality and accelerate deployment timelines. Despite the promise of MLOps, 
the journey from experimental models to reliable, scalable ML systems is fraught with challenges, especially for 
applications involving DL and DRL. This dilemma underscores a critical gap in the current ML landscape, which 
my thesis aims to address.

My research aims to contribute to the operationalization of ML systems, striving to make DL and DRL technologies more 
accessible and effective for real-world applications. My research not only addresses fundamental challenges within 
the ML lifecycle but also paves the way for future advancements in the deployment, validation, and monitoring of AI 
systems.
