**Mastering MLOps for Production-Ready and Machine Learning Pipelines:** This **Upskilling Program** is designed to 
empower software professionals with the necessary knowledge and skills for automating and streamlining machine learning 
model **development, deployment, and maintenance**, enabling efficient integration of AI capabilities into their 
software projects.

More specifically, this new Upskilling Program codeveloped with **SEMLA** teaches participants how to improve their 
**ML workflows using MLOps principles**. It consists of five modules, covering topics such as developing clean Python code, 
automating time-consuming tasks in ML workflows, building automated ML pipelines, and using Continuous 
Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) principles to engineer and maintain ML pipelines.

The Program is offered in a **hybrid format**, in which interactive presentations are combined with laboratory and 
problem-solving. **Expert testimonials and real-life case studies** will also be integrated into the training in order 
to concrete participants' learning. At the end of the program participants will be putting their newly found MLOps 
skills into action in a concrete **integrative project**.


## Course and Lab Objectives

By the end of the course, participants will have the skills and knowledge to **convert their manual ML workflows into
automated pipelines** with **continuous training** and will collaborate in teams to elevate their ML projects to the 
**MLOps level 2** stage of automation as part of their life-long learning and Continued Education path.


## Course Content

- **Module 1**: Create production-ready ML code and processes for deploying ML systems in accordance with SE/DevOps 
guidelines. 
- **Module 2**: Apply fundamental MLOps concepts to automate tedious tasks and effectively manage ML engineering 
workflows, employing basic MLOps techniques and tools. 
- **Module 3**: Transform experimental ML workflows into multi-step automated pipelines that continuously retrain and 
deploy models, using advanced MLOps concepts and tools. 
- **Module 4**: Apply CI/CD principles to maintain and evolve automated ML pipelines to continuously optimize and 
deliver quality-assured ML models in production. 
- **Module 5**: Creating an automated ML pipeline following MLOps automation Level 2 based on all the gained knowledge 
and skills.
